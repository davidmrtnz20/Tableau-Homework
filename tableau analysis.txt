The areas of Jersey City where bikers start their trips are mostly found in the Waterfront, Exchanges (Hudson and Place North), and Newport. Their popularit can be based on the many shops and eateries prevalent in those areas. In addition, the area is connected by other method of transportation due to the light rail and bus system found there. And instead of using your own car to navigate the city, one can conveniently leave their car in a parking lot then use public transportation to get around. Moreover, the same areas are as popular for biker ending their trips. The assumption can be made that patrons use stations like the one in Newport Pkwy to get back home when leaving New York or vice versa (leaving New Jersey). We can back this claim by examining the peaking times when people start their trips. The peak time is at 3pm the usual time a daytime job ends or even when school classes end. However, when we look at peak time when these trips end, times like 9am or 12pm, this is the time when patrons enter work and begin their lunch hour respectively.
